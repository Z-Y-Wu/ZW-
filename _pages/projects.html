<h2>2. The effects of plasmaspheric boundary on magnetosonic waves</h2>
<p>2.1 Plasmaspheric inner boundary layer</p>
The plasmaspheric inner boundary layer serves as a generator for high-frequency magnetosonic waves. High-frequency magnetosonic waves generated in off-equatorial region can be trapped in the plasmaspheric inner boundary layer, 
bounce along magnetic field lines, and drift around the Earth. When high-frequency magnetosonic waves propagate to the equatorial region, their normal angles deviate significantly from 90<sup>o</sup>, 
and their frequencies extend into the range above local lower hybrid frequency. In the plasmaspheric inner boundary layer, where conditions such as magnetic field, density, and proton distribution are relatively stable, 
high-frequency magnetosonic waves can undergo a prolonged process of cumulative amplification. (Wu et al., GRL, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091830">2021</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL100971">2022</a>)

<p>2.2 Plasmaspheric outer boundary layer</p>
The plasmaspheric outer boundary layer serves as a filter for magnetosonic waves. This filtering effect ultimately results in different intensity and frequency distribution characteristics of magnetosonic waves inside and outside the plasmasphere. (Wu et al., GRL, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103590">2023</a>)

<h2>1. The effects of plasmaspheric plume on whistler-mode hiss waves</h2>
The plasmaspheric plume is the generator and waveguide of hiss waves. The plasmaspheric plume can extend from the plasmaspheric core outward to the magnetopause. 
Compared to the plasmaspheric core, the plasmaspheric plume is more susceptible to infiltration by energetic electrons. These energy electrons with temperature 
anisotropy can effectively generate hiss waves within the plasmaspheric plume through linear and nonlinear instabilities. 
Simultaneously, the boundary layer of the plasmaspheric plume and its rich density ducts inside can guide hiss waves for long-distance migration over an extended period, ultimately filling most of the plasmasphere.
